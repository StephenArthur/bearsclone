# for each of the following output a value to the terminal using 'puts'
# the [array].inspect function will make this much tidier

# *********************************************************************

# 1.) create a array variable containing the first names of everyone on Sierra
# (that's Paul, Stephen, Mark, Adam, Sam, Amaal and Ged)

# 2.) order your array reverse alphabetically: Z to A

# 3.) output the name at index 4 of the updated array

# 4.) loop over your array and output the phrase
# "The name's Detective [name] Drebin, Sierra Squad" using each name in turn

# 5.) using a map create a new array from your existing where each name is reversed and in all caps

# 6.) create a new array containing the names of the days of the week
# (try to use a function to achieve this rather than typing it out)

# 7.) use this to create another array which cycles through the days of the week
# for thirty days starting with a sunday, loop over this and output each day in turn

# 8.) repeat 7 but after each Monday, Wednesday and Friday output "Happy Days"
# and after saturday output "what a day, Groovin' all week with you."

# 9.) in one line transform the array [[2,1,3], [4,9,8], [76,-4,3]]
# into a one dimensional array containing the sum of each nested element.

# 10.) Make an array containing the elements "QA", "Dev", "Meetings" and "Making Cake"
# loop over your array containing the days of the week and for each select the next available 
# member of the squad to do each task. Output them in the form: 
# "[day_of_week]: [Task_1]: [name_1], [task_2]: [name_2], [task_3]: [name_3], [task_4]: [name_4]"
