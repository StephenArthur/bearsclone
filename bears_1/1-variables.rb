# for each of the following output a value to the terminal using 'puts'

# *********************************************************************

# calculations:
# 1.) assign a variable called 'x', set its value to be 10

# 2.) assign a variable called 'y', set its value to be 5

# 3.) x plus y

# 4.) x mius y

# 5.) y to the power of x

# 6.) x squared minus y squared plus two times x plus y

# *********************************************************************

# strings:

# 7.) assign a variable called name, set its value to be your name

# 8.) assign a variable called age, set its value to be your age

# 9.) using string concatenation output the phrase
# "Hi! my name is Sam and I'm 33 years old." but using your name and age

# 10.) using string interpolation output the phrase
# "In 2 years time Sam will be 35 years old" but substituting your name and age

# 11.) assign a new variable to the phrase "I'm sorry, I can't splell very well"

# 12.) using a string function to find and replace, correct the spelling mistake

# 13.) convert the string to all caps

# 14.) using ruby's string docs:
# find a method which will reduce duplicate characters and convert the phrase
# "HHHHHHHHHEEEEEEELLLLLPPPPPP, IIIII'MM MEEEEEEEEELLLLTTTTTTIIIING" into valid english

# 15.) using ruby's string docs:
# find a method which will output true if the resulting phrase contains the word "HELP"

# *********************************************************************

# booleans/conditionals - output status after each with "puts status"

# 16.) write a conditional which will assign a variable called status to be "ok" if x + y = 15

# 17.) write a conditional which will set status to 'danger' if the condition in 15 is true

# 18.) write a conditional which will set status to be 'unknown' if either condition in 16 and 17 is false

# 19.) write a conditional which sets status to be "number" if:
# one equals two OR three equals the length of the string "abc" but NOT if "xyz"[2] equals "z"

# 20.) assign the boolean expressions for the last 4 questions to variables and 
# if all the variables evaluate to true set status to "Truth is beauty and beauty truth"

# bonus.) if you haven't already done so, refactor the preceding questions so that 
# each boolean expression is only defined in one place
